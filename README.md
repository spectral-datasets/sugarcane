# sugarcane
Data set of Visible-Near Infrared handled and micro- spectrometers – comparison of their accuracy for 
predicting some sugarcane properties.

Chemical and Nir spectra measurements were made on 60 sugarcane samples from different plant parts (leaves, 
stem or whole aerial part). Chemical parameters (total sugar content - TS, crude protein content - CP, 
acid detergent fiber - ADF, in vitro organic matter digestibility - IVOMD were determined. In parallel, 
reflectance spectra were measured using eight spectrometers. Absorbance data was calculated as log10 
(1/Reflectance).To illustrate, PLS-R results are showed for TS and CP.
